# KairoCLI

KairoCLI is a terminal-native AI coding assistant built with TypeScript and LangChain.

It is evolving toward a runtime-oriented coding agent architecture with:
- provider abstraction
- runtime session management
- workspace-aware execution
- tool orchestration
- git-aware workflows

# Install

## From npm

```bash
npm install -g @abhilov/kairo
```

## From source

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

# Setup

```bash
kairo setup
```

This configures:
- provider
- model
- API keys
- optional base URL

Configuration is stored in:

```bash
~/.terminal-agent/config.json
```

---

# Run

Development:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Production build:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Direct CLI from build output:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

Global CLI:

```bash
kairo
```

# Runtime Architecture

KairoCLI is shifting from:
- chatbot-style memory systems

toward:
- runtime session architecture
- execution state tracking
- workspace-aware orchestration
- coding-agent infrastructure

Current runtime state system includes:

```txt
runtime/
├── taskState.ts
├── executionState.ts
├── workspaceState.ts
└── sessionManager.ts
```

Runtime persistence:

```bash
~/.terminal-agent/session.json
```

---

# Docker

Build image:

```bash
docker build -t kairocli .
```

Run container:

```bash
docker run -it kairocli
```
